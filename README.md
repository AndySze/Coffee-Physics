## Coffee Physics
A lightweight physics engine, written in CoffeeScript

Early demos can be found here: [http://soulwire.co.uk/coffeephysics/](http://soulwire.co.uk/coffeephysics/)

### Note
I released this early for FITC, after only minor testing in Chrome. There are a lot of optimisations needed and over the coming weeks I'll be focussing these as well as adding 3D support. Consider this pre-release!
